Get it, text message I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but I'm never hurting nothing
Even then you don't worry none
And I'd like to give a shoutout to my niggas with the game plan
And shoutout to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We can keep the rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay lets rock and roll this
Time to go, lock stock and two smoking barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up to block and over
Times I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades Dior, my pants velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (yeah)
I listened to X, I peeped the bars (yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The games, a trap, protect, your heart (yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak we squeeze (squeeze)
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
She came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My vans, my braids, my mans, my babe
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped, out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' bout is not up for discussion

I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system pumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduce her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
'Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high 'cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
For all them hoes that was frontin' on niggas back in the day
(This for my broke jiggy niggas) Excuse me, fuck out my face.
They say wealth is in the mind, not the pocket,
I learned that from a very wise man
Okay, excuse me, Mr. Bill Collector, I got problems
My cheque arrive mañana, Imma pay my debt, I promise
I spent 20 thousand dollars with my partners in Bahamas
Another 20 thousand dollars on Rick Owens out in Barneys
I said, "excuse me, why the fuck you looking, what's your problem?"
I swear we gon' have drama if you touch my tailored garments
All you see is niggas here, so that mean it's triggers there
What you mean? We got weed, and codeine and bricks for sale
I bet a lot of niggas plottin', so you know I got that heater, bruh
Drive my side in Harlem, catch me ridin' with my nina, bruh
She got a apple bottom that remind you of Bonita, bruh
Oh, you mean like Q-Tip? Now that girl my new bitch
(Excuse me) No, I believe the proper term's "excuse you"
I could switch up on you niggas and start shittin' if I choose to
That's when the new you, become a different since they knew you
I guess the new me is just gon' take some gettin' used to
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue had a loss for words
'Cause my feelings just said it all
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby I'm just rappin' to this LSD
